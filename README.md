# Hand-Cricket-Game-using-Python
Project Description: In this project, you will create a command-line Hand Cricket game using Python. Hand Cricket is a popular game in which two players take turns to bat and bowl, with the aim of scoring as many runs as possible. The game is played using hand gestures, where each player selects a number between 1 and 6, and if the numbers match, the batting player is out, and if the numbers are different, the batting player scores the number of runs selected.

The program will have the following features:

User Input: The program will prompt the user to select a number between 1 and 6 for their turn.

Random Number Generation: The program will generate a random number between 1 and 6 for the computer's turn.

Batting and Bowling: The program will allow the user to choose whether they want to bat or bowl first.

Scoring: The program will keep track of the runs scored by the batting player and display the score after each turn.

Innings: The program will allow both players to take turns batting and bowling, with each player getting a fixed number of overs.

Winning Condition: The program will declare the winner based on the highest score at the end of the game.
